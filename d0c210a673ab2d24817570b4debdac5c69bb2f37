      "message": "If turning this off here *could* interfere with debugging / other things for users who don\u0027t use this feature, then I wish it could be avoided somehow. Is there any reasonable way to store and access a configuration variable for this? It might sound over-the-top, but I\u0027m biased as someone who doesn\u0027t use Restrict USB.",
